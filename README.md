The Choose your own adventure is a branching game, where you have multiple different paths and options that you can choose. And each choice affects the choice in the future. And eventually you are trying to go down the correct path. ![image](https://github.com/eromsubebe/llm_cassandra-game/assets/70914709/b1dac8a2-097c-4e51-860d-e63efbfa5cef)
